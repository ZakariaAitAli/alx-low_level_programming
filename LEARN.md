## Introduction

The ALX Software Engineer Program focuses on providing comprehensive training in software engineering, covering both high-level and low-level concepts. Low-level programming involves working closer to the hardware, dealing with memory management, system resources, and optimizing performance.

These projects will cover a range of topics including data structures, algorithms, memory management, system programming, and more. By completing these projects, you'll develop a deeper understanding of how software interacts with hardware and gain valuable experience in writing efficient and reliable code.

## Project List

1. **Linked List Implementation:** Implement a linked list data structure in C, including functions for insertion, deletion, and traversal.
2. **Stack and Queue Implementation:** Create implementations of stack and queue data structures using arrays or linked lists.
3. **Binary Search Tree:** Implement a binary search tree data structure in C and write functions for insertion, deletion, and search operations.
4. **Sorting Algorithms:** Implement various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quicksort, and compare their performance.
5. **Memory Allocator:** Develop a simple memory allocator that manages dynamic memory allocation and deallocation efficiently.
6. **File Compression:** Write a program to compress and decompress files using techniques like Huffman coding or Run-Length Encoding.
7. **Shell Implementation:** Create a basic Unix shell in C, supporting commands execution, I/O redirection, piping, and background processes.
8. **Concurrency:** Explore concurrency in C by implementing multithreaded programs using pthreads or synchronization mechanisms like semaphores.
9. **Networking:** Develop client-server applications using socket programming in C to communicate over a network.
10. **Algorithm Challenges:** Solve algorithmic challenges such as searching, sorting, graph traversal, and dynamic programming problems on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank.
